@article{Erol-Kantarci2011,
abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in various applications in the terrestrial environment and the rapid advancement of the WSN technology have motivated the development of Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs). UASNs and terrestrial WSNs have several common properties while there are several challenges particular to UASNs that are mostly due to acoustic communications, and inherent mobility. These challenges call for novel architectures and protocols to ensure successful operation of the UASN. Localization is one of the fundamental tasks for UASNs which is required for data tagging, node tracking, target detection, and it can be used for improving the performance of medium access and network protocols. Recently, various UASN architectures and a large number of localization techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these architectures and localization methods. To familiarize the reader with the UASNs and localization concepts, we start our paper by providing background information on localization, state-of-the-art oceanographic systems, and the challenges of underwater communications. We then present our detailed survey, followed by a discussion on the performance of the localization techniques and open research issues. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

@article{Ur-Rehman2018,
abstract = {This chapter focuses on wireless communications, including a discussion of the wireless communication channel and how it impacts the data transmission. The propagation models and fading are discussed further. These phenomena might result in the data to be corrupted in transit from source to sink; some mechanisms must be employed to counter the data corruption. Error concealment methods to counter the problem of data corruption are also discussed in this chapter. They are mainly divided into retransmission techniques and forward error correcting codes. Error correcting codes attempt to correct errors at the sink without a need for retransmission. They are more important from the perspective of this writing and are briefly introduced here. However, their applications are discussed in later chapters.},

@article{Paull2014,
abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in underwater environments is particularly challenging due to the rapid attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency signals. Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system. Past approaches to solve the AUV localization problem have employed expensive inertial sensors, used installed beacons in the region of interest, or required periodic surfacing of the AUV. While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of AUV navigation and localization, as well as a description of some of the more commonly used methods. In addition, we highlight areas of future research potential. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},
