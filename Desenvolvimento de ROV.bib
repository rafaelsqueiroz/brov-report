abstract = {Evolutionary processes have shaped acoustic communication behaviours of remarkable complexity, for thus many researches have led to the development of innovative receiver structures for robust underwater acoustic communication. As underwater channel model, attenuation, transmission distance, low power consumption, highly Signal to Noise Ratio, Bit Error Ratio, inter-symbol interference, error coding and alternative modulation strategies, are of primary concern in the whole study and in particularly the proposition of the transceiver structure and his design. The values of these parameters above - mentioned are crucial to improve the wireless underwater communication. In addition, the battery powered Network nodes limit the life time of the proposed transceiver. This paper aims to survey the existing and the reliability of this transceiver and its applicability to underwater communication based on these simulations parameters values that are evaluated and presented. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Apathy is the neuropsychiatric symptom that correlates most highly with Huntington's disease progression, and, like early patterns of neurodegeneration, is associated with lesions to cortico-striatal connections. However, due to its multidimensional nature and elusive etiology, treatment options are limited. Objectives: To disentangle underlying white matter microstructural correlates across the apathy spectrum in Huntington's disease. Methods: Forty-six Huntington's disease individuals (premanifest (N=22) and manifest (N=24)) and 35 healthy controls were scanned at 3-tesla and underwent apathy evaluation using the short-Problem Behavior Assessment and short-Lille Apathy Rating Scale, with the latter being characterized into three apathy domains, namely emotional, cognitive, and auto-activation deficit. Diffusion- tensor imaging was used to study whether individual differences in specific cortico-striatal tracts predicted apathy symptoms and domains. Results: We elucidate that apathy profiles may develop along differential timelines, with the auto-activation deficit domain manifesting prior to motor onset. Furthermore, diffusion-tensor imaging revealed that inter- individual variability in the disruption of discrete cortico-striatal tracts might explain the heterogeneous severity of apathy profiles. Specifically, higher levels of auto-activation deficit symptoms significantly correlated with increased mean diffusivity in the right uncinate fasciculus. Conversely, those with severe cognitive apathy demonstrated increased mean diffusivity in the right frontostriatal tract and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to caudate nucleus tract. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that white matter correlates associated with emotional, cognitive, and auto-activation subtypes may elucidate the heterogeneous nature of apathy in Huntington's disease, as such opening a door for individualized pharmacological management of multidimensional apathy symptoms in other neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {The design of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with a size of 18.41 cm × 29.50 cm × 33.50 cm, and a weight of 15.64 kg, is introduced herein. The main goal is to capture underwater video by remote control communication in real time via Ethernet protocol. The ROV moves under the six brushless motors governed through a smart PID controller (Proportional + Integral + Derivative) and by using pulse-wide modulation with short pulses of 1 $\mu$s to improve the stability of the position in relation to the translational, ascent or descent, and rotational movements on three axes to capture images of 800 × 640 pixels on a video graphic array standard. The motion control, 3D position, temperature sensing, and video capture are performed at the same time, exploiting the four cores of the Raspberry Pi 3, using the threading library for parallel computing. In such a way, experimental results show that the video capture stage can process up to 42 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 3. The remote control of the ROV is executed under a graphical user interface developed in Python, which is suitable for different operating systems, such as GNU/Linux, Windows, Android, and OS X. The proposed ROV can reach up to 100 m underwater, thus solving the issue of divers who can only reach 30 m depth. In addition, the proposed ROV can be useful in underwater applications such as surveillance, operations, maintenance, and measurement.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are heavily used in order to monitor the underwater environment and execute many different operations. In particular, ROVs are used in many complex and even dangerous situations, thanks to the possibility to control them remotely in real time via wired telemetry systems. For instance, they are used due to defuse bombs, or to inspect pipelines, both in normal situations and in presence of severe damage. While the presence of a wired control system is very important in order to guide a ROV, the same system often represents the main limitation in terms of mobility. In fact, the mobility of the ROV is constrained by the cable length and, as the ROV moves, there is a chance that its control cable gets entangled in rocks or man-made equipment, such as pipes. This thesis proposes a solution for this problem: a multi-technology and multi-hop wireless ROV control system. In particular, three different technologies are compared and analyzed: underwater acoustic, optical and electromagnetic (radio-frequency (RF)) communications. The purpose of this first analysis is to find the best transmission technique in terms of expected bitrate versus distance, from the ROV to the remote controller, for typical operational distances of a few meters up to about 100 meters.},

abstract = {Underwater wireless communications can enable many scientific, environmental, commercial, safety, and military applications. Wireless signal transmission is also crucial to remotely control instruments in ocean observatories and to enable coordination of swarms of autonomous underwater vehicles and robots, which will play the role of mobile nodes in future ocean observation networks by virtue of their flexibility and reconfigurability. To make underwater applications viable, efficient communication protocols among underwater devices, which are based on acoustic wireless technology for distances over one hundred meters, must be enabled because of the high attenuation and scattering that affect radio and optical waves, respectively. The unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel — such as very limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, high propagation delays, and time-varying multipath and fading — require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols to network multiple devices, either static or mobile, potentially over multiple hops. In this article, we provide an overview of recent medium access control, routing, transport, and cross-layer networking protocols. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE.},

In the consideration with nonlinearity and external disturbance, the dynamic model of a portable AUV has been established on the basis of its actuation and control characteristics. An adaptive nonlinear second order sliding mode controller has been deduced to eliminate the chattering motion through a sliding surface during the path following control. On the uncertainties of external disturbances, an adaptive tuning law has been selected to estimate the upper bound of disturbance. In the lake experiments, the proposed controller not only provides better response with faster convergence and smaller overshoot, but also eliminates the chattering effect of control output, in compare with the controller with linear and PID second order sliding mode surface.},

We here address the in-plane orbital assembly case, where two translational and one rotational degrees of freedom are considered. Each spacecraft involved in the assembly is both chaser and target at the same time. The guidance and control strategies are LQR-based, designed to take into account the evolving shape and mass properties of the assembling spacecraft. Each spacecraft runs symmetric algorithms. The relative navigation is based on augmenting the target's state vector by introducing, as extra state components, the target's control inputs. By using the proposed navigation method, a chaser spacecraft can estimate the relative position, the attitude and the control inputs of a target spacecraft, flying in its proximity. The proposed approaches are successfully validated via hardware-in-the-loop experimentation, using four autonomous three-degree-of-freedom robotic spacecraft simulators, floating on a flat floor.},

abstract = {Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors: attenuation that increases with signal frequency, time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound (1500 m/s). The background noise, although often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance, and may be extremely limited. Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE.},
